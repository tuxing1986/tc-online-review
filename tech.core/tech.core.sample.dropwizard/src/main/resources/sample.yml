# Register model/service/exception
# There are 2 ways to bind your resources.
#   1. Run from APIApplication.main() -- Register using following attributes will load appropriate
#      model/service classes on boot time, and enables to speak V3 API.
#         For (1) to work, service should implement interfaces defined under com.appirio.tech.core.api.v3.service package
#   2. Run from custom main() -- Alternatively, you can create you own custom Application and Configuration
#      classes of DropWizard, and implement V3 API by yourself.
